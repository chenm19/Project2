# Project 2 @ CSC 201 Fall 2024: AVL Tree (Part 2)

## Pledged Work Policy

This is a ___Pledged Work___ assignment.  This means that the work you submit for grading ___must___ be your work product.  
You may not submit the work of others outside of your team, or the modification of work of others outside of your team.
You are encouraged to talk with each other about general problems.  For example, you may talk to someone about "What does it mean when the compiler says there is a semicolon missing on line 20", or "I can not get my assignment template to download from GitHub, what did you do?".  However, you may not engage in "Could you send me a copy of your work so I can see how to get started?".  You may get full and detailed assistance from me, the Teaching Assistant (TA), and the TAs in the Computer Science Center.  If you have any question about the appropriateness of assistance, do not hesitate to consult with me.

If I believe you have violated our ___Pledge Work___ agreement, I will pursue this matter through the college Honor Council.

## Overview

An AVL Tree is a type of self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) that ensures that the tree is approximately balanced, preventing it from degenerating into a linked list. An AVL Tree remains balanced as elements are inserted or deleted.

In this project, you will implement:
1. A generic BST with an iterator interface. (You developed this in Project 1, which you can use as is or update.)
2. A generic AVL Tree with an iterator interface.
3. You will insert a sorted dataset into the BST and AVL Tree.
4.
